# FormFill

Webex browser addon to fill forms with random data. Useful for testing/development purposes.

## Main goal:
- Fill form with random values.
- Guess the value type and prefill decent placeholders.

## Could haves:
- Save filled in form values to reuse later.
- Both page specific and searchable from a list
- Add option to fill form with dangerous data to check if stuff breaks.
